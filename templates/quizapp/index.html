        <h3>What is personal care?</h3>
        <p>
            Personal care is a broad term used to refer to supporting with personal hygiene and toileting, along with
            dressing and maintaining your personal appearance.

            It can cover, but is not limited to:

            Bathing and showering, including bed-baths
            Applying lotions and creams as required
            Dressing and getting ready for bed
            Oral hygiene
            Applying make-up, and hair care
            Support with shaving
            Foot care, especially if you are diabetic need to be extra vigilant with your feet
            Helping you to the toilet, including using a commode or bed pan
            Changing continence pads, along with cleaning intimate areas
            Support moving position in bed, to stretch and prevent bed sores
            Changing or maintaining a stoma or catheter bag, or other form of clinical intervention
            In getting to know you as a person, your care plan will outline your likes and dislikes, the hygiene or
            beauty
            products you want to use and what – and who – you feel most comfortable with. Particular tasks, such as
            cutting
            nails, shaving and diabetic foot care, will always be outlined in your support plan with specific
            instructions
            for your carer.

            Each carer is expertly trained to provide personal care in a way that is discreet and respectful of your
            personal boundaries. They undertake extensive training where they learn the importance of enabling your
            dignity
            and independence at all times.

            Even though carers are trained to provide all aspects of personal care, there may be some things you’d
            prefer to
            do for yourself. A good carer will always give you space when you want it and encourage your independence
            wherever they can.
        </p>

        <h3>The options for personal care</h3>
        <p>
            Like all forms of care, support with personal care is built completely around your individual needs and
            personal
            routines. If you like to wash before breakfast or have a bath before going to bed, a carer will happily
            follow
            your schedule, letting you live the way you want.

            With home care, you have the choice of having a visiting carer – someone who visits at set times of the day
            or
            even overnight – to provide the support you need. If you require ongoing support, it may be best to have a
            live-in carer, living at home with you to provide 24 hour care. Read more about what live in care covers
            here.

            Many carers support with other tasks in addition to personal care. In fact, they’re also trained to
            administer
            medication, help those with limited mobility to move safely around the home (especially using hoists and
            supports) and can prepare meals, complete household chores and even offer companionship, ongoing support and
            encouragement.

            Please get in touch with our team to find out more about what a carer can support with. Your local Helping
            Hands
            specialist can visit you at home to discuss the options and arrange the type of support you’re looking for.
